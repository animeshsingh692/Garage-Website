      <h2>7. Kumar Sanu</h2>
      <p>
        It is almost impossible to find a 90s playlist without a Kumar Sanu track in it. Kumar Sanu has been one of Bollywood’s
        most acclaimed playback singers especially in the 1990s. He started his career in the late 1980s by his original name
        Kedarnath Bhattacharya which he later changed to Kumar Sanu as his style of singing was greatly influenced by the legendary
        singer Kishore Kumar. Kumar Sanu has won five consecutive film fare awards which is a record in itself.  Few of his many memorable
        songs include Aye kash ke hum from the movie Kabhi haan kabhi na (1993),  ‘Yeh kaali kaali ankhen’ from Baazigar (1993),
        Jo haal dil ka from Sarfarosh (1999).
